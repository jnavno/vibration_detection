TODO:

- SOC values still output 0.0. Need to correct that
- Update README file
- flash sensor_test.cpp

- Add wifi disabling and other peripherals to lower consumption

- Implement zero-crossing rate ZCR and FFT combined to acc for gyroscope data


## Vibration Classification Strategy

This table outlines how vibration data is classified into **machete, chainsaw, or no activity** using **FFT (acceleration data) and Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR) on gyroscope data**.

| **Activity**  | **FFT Peak (Acceleration)** | **ZCR (Gyroscope Motion)** |
|--------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Chainsaw** | High (100-300 Hz) | Medium (consistent oscillations) |
| **Machete**  | Moderate (50-150 Hz) | Very High (sudden swings) |
| **No Activity** | Low (no strong peak) | Very Low (almost no motion) |

### How It Works:
1. **FFT Analysis (Accelerometer Data)**
   - Determines dominant vibration frequencies.
   - Helps differentiate between high-frequency (chainsaw) and lower-frequency (machete) activity.

2. **Zero-Crossing Rate (Gyroscope Data)**
   - Counts how often the signal crosses zero.
   - Helps detect chaotic swings (machete) vs. smoother, repetitive vibrations (chainsaw).

3. **Final Classification:**
   - **Chainsaw:** High FFT peak + Medium ZCR.
   - **Machete:** Moderate FFT peak + Very High ZCR.
   - **No Activity:** Low FFT peak + Very Low ZCR.
