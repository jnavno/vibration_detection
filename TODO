TODO:

- implement deep sleep cycling
- Fine tune the detection frequency for machete and handsaw

-current measurements idle and computing Work values+sending over lora( write small snippet) on batt only DONE

-create pcb hat and plan out for several op amp footprints (as purchased). embedd MPU6050 DONE

- Decide whether mosfet is needed after all. list pros and cons anyway DONE


Data Collection and Storage:
Within inspectTreeShaking(), collect accelerometer data during each sampling cycle.
Store the accelerometer data in a suitable data structure.

Batch Creation:DONE
Define conditions for creating a batch (e.g., number of cycles before going to sleep, sufficient vibration data).
Create batches of data that include accelerometer values, sampling cycle references, and timestamps.

Excel File Handling:DONE
Implement functionality to write batches to an Excel file stored locally on the ESP32S3 memory.
You may need to explore libraries or develop your own functions to handle Excel file operations in C.

MQTT Integration:
Implement MQTT functionality to send the Excel file when required.
Use appropriate MQTT libraries compatible with the ESP32S3 and your MQTT broker.

Code Integration:
Integrate the above functionalities into the existing code structure, ensuring compatibility and proper function execution.
Modify the main loop to handle data collection, batch creation, Excel file writing, and MQTT communication based on your defined conditions.
