Data Ready Interrupt

The Data Ready Interrupt triggers whenever new data is available from the MPU6050’s sensors (gyroscope, accelerometer, temperature). Instead of continuously polling the MPU6050 for new data, the microcontroller (Heltec V3 in your case) can enter a lower-power state or perform other tasks while waiting for the interrupt.

When the MPU6050 has collected new sensor data, it will pull the INT pin high, signaling to the microcontroller that it’s time to read the data.

Benefits of Using Data Ready Interrupt

    Reduce Polling, Minimize Noise and Data Errors:
        By eliminating constant polling, which could interfere with other system tasks, you reduce I2C bus activity and lower the risk of bus contention errors, communication noise, or corrupted reads.
        Interrupt-driven reading ensures you always read fresh data, thus preventing "stale" sensor values from being processed.
        Interrupts reduce the chances of synchronization errors, since the MPU6050 signals exactly when data is available.

    Improve Power Efficiency:
        The Heltec V3 can stay in a low-power or idle state until the MPU6050 signals that it has data ready, reducing unnecessary power consumption.
        The MPU6050 can buffer data in its FIFO (First In, First Out) queue until the microcontroller is ready to handle it, further reducing the need for frequent I2C communications.
        
        //what we really want it to wake up the heltec from deep sleep, have it in the lowest power mode possible so that it can toggle the sensor on, let the sensor do its buffering data for the established time by the heltec algorithm, read the data from the sensor, turn off the sensor, run the algorithmic computation, give a result (that we'll implement later) and go to sleep. A question for you here would be if the time that the sensor uses to do its buffering can be determined by the heltec code or not. If so advise an implement some code there.

        Seamless Integration with Deep Sleep/Wake-Up Cycles:
        Deep sleep is used to reduce power consumption between active periods. When the Heltec V3 enters deep sleep, the MPU6050 can still operate in its own low-power mode, collecting data at a slower rate or waiting for an interrupt event.

        // we want the sensor to be completely switched off though when the heltec is in deep sleep, so we spend the least amount of energy. But as mentioned before , if it was possible we would want the sensor to do its buffering in the lowest possible power consumption mode.

        The Data Ready interrupt can function independently of the deep sleep cycle. You can set it up so that, once the microcontroller wakes from deep sleep (triggered by external events like the wake-up interrupt from the shake sensor), it checks whether any data is ready from the MPU6050.

        //An alternative here would be to set the sensor to be in lowest power mode possible during its buffering data time. So I am wondering if it could still do its data buffering when in low power mode or not. Advice there an implementation

        You don’t need to worry about the Data Ready interrupt interfering with the Heltec V3's deep sleep cycle. The INT pin from the MPU6050 can trigger an interrupt after the Heltec wakes up, ensuring the device only processes new data when it’s awake and ready.

        // Ideally, the gpio would just listen for a high from the sensor after the established buffering times had elapsed. Then read it would read the data in 1 go and switch off the sensor, compute the algorithm, give a result and further go to deep sleep

KEY UPDATES FOR MODULARIZATION OF THE CODE
        Use I2Cdev library's FIFO to read accelerometer data efficiently.
Keep the deep sleep and interrupt-based wake-up functionality.
Print detailed information at every decision step (threshold evaluations).
Handle power cycling of the MPU6050 correctly between reads.
